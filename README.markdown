Javascript Application Platform
================================

A very bland name for sure. I will change it as I define it better. This is the best I can do for now. I want to create and open source enterprize app platform. Something like salesforce but open source. 

At this stage I am just playing around but I do know some things. 

It will be all javascript. Except for building packages I might use some python to help manage some rote tacks. 

It will be based on jquery. 

Forward looking, HTML 5, canvas, location will all be supported.
